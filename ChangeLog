	* src/SerfIoThread.cpp: fixed receive logic to handle additional
	  msgpack object encodings in a single block of data received from
  	  the serf agent.  For example, a 'stop' response appended to a
	  log record.

2015-09-05  Chris Love  <cjlove@san.rr.com>

	* Changed API for methods in SerfClient class, now return a
	  SerfClient::SerfResponse enum as the return code and return
	  other return values by reference from the caller.  This allows
	  returning an indication that a client request timed out versus
	  returning a meaningful response.

	* Added logic to handle timeouts waiting for response from Serf
	  agent.

	  REQUEST channels from the channel map when the (sole) response
	  is received in processRpc()

2015-08-29  Chris Love  <cjlove@san.rr.com>

	* Initial implementation, including framework for supporting
	  synchronous methods on SerfClient class
