	* Restructure SerfClientExample as "CLI" to better exercise
	  commands and event and log monitoring.  Resolved issue with
	  reception of user events (msgpack-c usage problem)


2015-10-05  Chris Love  <cjlove@san.rr.com>

	* Added support for 'stats' command

2015-09-10  Chris Love  <cjlove@san.rr.com>

	* Added support for 'stream' command and subsequent async event
  	  handling.

2015-09-07  Chris Love  <cjlove@san.rr.com>

	* src/SerfIoThread.cpp: fixed receive logic to handle additional
	  msgpack object encodings in a single block of data received from
  	  the serf agent.  For example, a 'stop' response appended to a
	  log record.

2015-09-05  Chris Love  <cjlove@san.rr.com>

	* Changed API for methods in SerfClient class, now return a
	  SerfClient::SerfResponse enum as the return code and return
	  other return values by reference from the caller.  This allows
	  returning an indication that a client request timed out versus
	  returning a meaningful response.

	* Added logic to handle timeouts waiting for response from Serf
	  agent. 

2015-08-30  Chris Love  <cjlove@san.rr.com>

	* Added support for 'monitor' command and subsequent async event
	  handling.  Added initial support for 'stop' command (issues
  	  remain). 
	* Added support for 'leave' request
	* Added ChannelType enum to ChannelBase, added logic to remove
	  REQUEST channels from the channel map when the (sole) response
	  is received in processRpc()

2015-08-29  Chris Love  <cjlove@san.rr.com>

	* Initial implementation, including framework for supporting
	  synchronous methods on SerfClient class
