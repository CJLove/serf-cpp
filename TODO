Short-term
==========
o Remaining commands supported by serf RPC definition
o Stream and Monitor commands and callbacks to user code for events
  and logs
o Extend SerfClientExample to exercise remaining requests
o Clean up socket code in SerfIoThread. Consider boost::asio or
  alternatives for the sync-async pattern implemented for the
  "synchronous" SerfClient library methods
o More test code

Long-term
=========
o Alternative implementation supporting C++11 (or newer), dropping boost
  dependency
