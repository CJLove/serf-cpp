Short-term
==========
o Library versioning
o Code cleanup; additional refactoring for methods in SerfClient class
o Support different log levels
o Clean up socket code in SerfIoThread class. Consider boost::asio or
  alternatives for the sync-async pattern implemented for the
  "synchronous" SerfClient library methods
o More test code
o Consider using exceptions for error returns rather than the
  SerfResponse enum

Long-term
=========
o Alternative implementation supporting C++11 (or newer), dropping boost
  dependency
